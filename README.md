# Phil-Hue-Smartlight-System
This Arduino project allows you to control digital output pins (13, 12, 11) based on characters received through the serial communication. The code is designed to respond to specific characters ('Z', 'z', 'Y', 'y', 'X', 'x') to turn on and off corresponding pins.

# Prerequisites:
- Arduino board
