# Phil-Hue-Smartlight-System
The main objective was to program an application to a breadboard in order to create a smartlight system, powered by an arduino uno board. By programming an app using the C language and programming the bluetooth adapter on the breadboard to communicate with the app that was created for an android, we were able to successfully control the leds on the breadboard with the phone application.
